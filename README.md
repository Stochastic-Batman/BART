# BART

CNN for Simpsons character classification

A Convolutional Neural Network built from scratch to classify images of Simpsons characters. The goal is to train a model that can accurately recognize multiple characters from the show, using a dataset organized by character and evaluated with the Macro F1 Score. No pre-trained models or transfer learning are allowed; the entire pipeline is custom-built.

## Why "BART"?

The repo name "BART" is a reference to Bart Simpson, one of the main characters from The Simpsons. It also nods to the popular NLP architecture "BERT," blending the themes of deep learning and the Simpsons - even though BERT is not a vision model.
